# My Freqtrade Scripts

A collection of python and bash scripts that utilize [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) library for backtesting custom trading strategies.  

The repositories for the actual trading bots are kept private. 

A sample of the output (based on real data and strategy) is included in `backtest_output_with_roi.txt`
