# My Freqtrade Scripts

A collection python and bash scripts I wrote for backtesting custom strategies utilized in my trading bot.  

The main backtest script is `cindicatorAB_custom_bt.py`. A sample of the output (based on real data and strategy) is included in `backtest_output_with_roi.txt` 

The repositories for the actual trading bots are kept private.
